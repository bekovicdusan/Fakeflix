## üéØ About

I have started this project with the purpose of learning how to structure a Web App of a mid-level complexity integrating the Redux logic.<br/>
I've tried to replicate the original layout as much as possible and I've also made some improvements in some sections inserting route animations and micro-interactions. I've also inserted a really close clone of Netflix's original splash animation, made entirely with CSS, as well as the play animation.<br/>
I put a lot of effort into it and I hope that you could like it.<br/><br/>
The Web App redirects you to an authentication page, in which you can choose to sign up or to sign in: you can sign in with your custom account or with your Google account. Once you are logged in and after the splash animation, you will land on the homepage, in which you can find a mix of movies and series divided into rows.<br/>
Each row represents a movie/series category: you can click on it and you will be redirected to the selected category, a page that loads thousands of movies with an infinite scroll. You can also navigate to the movies page, series page, new & popular page (that contains the upcoming movies/series and the most popular ones) or you can navigate to your favorites page.<br/>
You can add/remove movies/series through the plus and minus buttons that you can find hovering each poster or opening a single movie's detail modal. If you click on the play button you can enjoy a custom CSS-only play animation with Fakeflix's brand name.<br/>
You have also the option to search through TMDd's catalogue using the search functionality inside the fixed navbar: you can search by movie name, actor or movie director.<br/><br/>
Go try it and please let me know if enjoyed it with a ‚≠êÔ∏è, I would appreciate it a lot.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
